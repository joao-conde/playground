// requested duration and notifies the caller once the delay completes. A thread
// is spawned **per** call to `delay`. This is obviously a terrible

// not use this strategy. However, it can be implemented with few lines of code,

// operating system detail. Because of this, we must manually implement the
// `Future`.
//
// However, it is nice to expose the API as an `async fn`. A useful idiom is
// to manually define a private future and then use it from a public `async
// fn` API.
